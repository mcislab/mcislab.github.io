        <span><b class="slideheading">Research is your Destiny</b><br />You never give up, and don't mind making your hands dirty. The truth is out there,<br/>and you will find it. Honesty and ethics are not hollow terms for you. Chaos only exists<br/>to bring back order. You keep notes of everything you do, just in case. Always think<br/>before you do, and do before you report.<a href="join.html" title="MCIS == Research" class="readmore">Join MCIS!</a></span>

        <span><b class="slideheading">Knowledge is your Favourite Type of Food</b><br />You're a curious person by nature. Once you start reading a book, you can't put it down without<br/> finishing it. Learning is an incremental process, every tidbit helps. Google is your best friend.<a href="join.html" title="MCIS == learning" class="readmore">Join MCIS!</a></span>

        <span><b class="slideheading">Are You a Code Ninja?</b><br />You know the essential concepts of &gt;10 programming languages and exploit them<br/> as needed. You think before you code. Reuse is your middle name. You use Perl<br/> scripts for regular expressions, Prolog code for querying, Java for its huge<br/> array of libraries, and even C++ if that's what it takes to finish a project successfully.<a href="join.html" title="MCIS == Code Ninja-ing" class="readmore">Join MCIS!</a></span>

        <span><b class="slideheading">Teacher is your Middle Name</b><br />From kindergarten on, you've had this irresistible urge to explain things to others. Knowledge<br/> means nothing without sharing it with others. You hate memorization. You translate complex<br/> definitions into funny anecdotes, abstract structures into simple graphics, tables full of numbers<br/> into smart graphs.<a href="join.html" title="MCIS == Teaching" class="readmore">Join MCIS!</a></span>

Did the performance of our system degrade compared to the previous release? How can we improve the energy consumption of our system? Will this change have nasty consequences on other features?<br />

          <h4>Build Maintenance</h4>
          <p>Did you know that build files like makefiles, ant files and configuration files change relatively more than source code files do? And did you know that in <b>up to 27% of the work items</b> in which a source code file is changed, a build file needs to be updated?</p>

          <h4>Release Engineering</h4>
          <p>What is release engineering and which activities need to be performed? What are <b>today's challenges</b> for the build and integration phases of release engineering? How does our work fit with these challenges?</p>

          <h4>Concern Mining</h4>
          <p>Identifying crosscutting concerns is tedious. Existing tools only return a set of function names, cannot deal with noise in identifiers, and merely yield a set of words without structure. We propose to <b>use the system's development history</b> to address these three shortcomings.</p>
