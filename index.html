        <span><b class="slideheading">Research is your Destiny</b><br />You never give up, and don't mind making your
            hands dirty. The truth is out there,<br />and you will find it. Honesty and ethics are not hollow terms for
            you. Chaos only exists<br />to bring back order. You keep notes of everything you do, just in case. Always
            think<br />before you do, and do before you report.<a href="join.html" title="MCIS == Research"

        <span><b class="slideheading">Knowledge is your Favourite Type of Food</b><br />You're a curious person by
            nature. Once you start reading a book, you can't put it down without<br /> finishing it. Learning is an
            incremental process, every tidbit helps. Google is your best friend.<a href="join.html"

        <span><b class="slideheading">Are You a Code Ninja?</b><br />You know the essential concepts of &gt;10
            programming languages and exploit them<br /> as needed. You think before you code. Reuse is your middle
            name. You use Perl<br /> scripts for regular expressions, Prolog code for querying, Java for its huge<br />
            array of libraries, and even C++ if that's what it takes to finish a project successfully.<a

        <span><b class="slideheading">Teacher is your Middle Name</b><br />From kindergarten on, you've had this
            irresistible urge to explain things to others. Knowledge<br /> means nothing without sharing it with others.
            You hate memorization. You translate complex<br /> definitions into funny anecdotes, abstract structures
            into simple graphics, tables full of numbers<br /> into smart graphs.<a href="join.html"

        <p><span class="essence">MCIS helps practitioners maintain their software systems.</span> For example, which
            files should be tested or fixed first and by who? Which bug to fix first? Did the performance of our system
            degrade compared to the previous release? How can we improve the energy consumption of our system? Will this
            change have nasty consequences on other features?<br />

                <h4>Build Maintenance</h4>
                <p>Did you know that build files like makefiles, ant files and configuration files change relatively
                    more than source code files do? And did you know that in <b>up to 27% of the work items</b> in which
                    a source code file is changed, a build file needs to be updated?</p>

                <p>What is release engineering and which activities need to be performed? What are <b>today's
                        challenges</b> for the build and integration phases of release engineering? How does our work
                    fit with these challenges?</p>

                <h4>Concern Mining</h4>
                <p>Identifying crosscutting concerns is tedious. Existing tools only return a set of function names,
                    cannot deal with noise in identifiers, and merely yield a set of words without structure. We propose
                    to <b>use the system's development history</b> to address these three shortcomings.</p>
