        <h1>Join MCIS!</h1>
        <p>If you recognize yourself in the vision behind MCIS, and are interested in a PhD or Master's degree, or you
            would like to be a research intern, work on a project or cook for us, don't hesitate to contact us at
            <script
                type='text/javascript'>var a = new Array('gmail.com', 'lab.mcis@'); document.write("<a href='mailto:" + a[1] + a[0] + "'>" + a[1] + a[0] + "</a>");</script>
            <noscript><a href="mailto:lab DOT mcis WHAT gmail DOT com">lab DOT mcis WHAT gmail DOT com</a><i>(DOT=. and
                    WHAT=@)</i></noscript> (see below)! Don't worry about our reaction, we respect you and will look at
            your file. If we think things might not work out, we will still provide you with feedback.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>So, <b>what can we offer you?</b> A friendly research environment, stimulating discussions, pragmatic advice
            and mentoring, support in all your endeavours, and, above all, fun! Yes, there will be a lot of work and
            sometimes you will curse yourself, but if you fit our vision, you will be armed enough to survive such
            stressful periods. And remember, after rain comes sunshine (or ice)! And don't forget about Kingston
            (Ontario) itself. It's a great, surprising city next to Lake Ontario with lots of things going on and a
            splendid nature.</p>
        <br />
        <p>OK, where's the catch, i.e., <b>what do we expect from you?</b> As a PhD or Master's student, you will need
            to follow some courses, perform research, present and report your work at conferences and in journal papers,
            assist with some courses, and help managing the lab. Don't worry if this sounds like a lot to do, you'll
            experience one thing at a time and slowly roll into things.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If you're still interested, contact us at
            <script
                type='text/javascript'>var a = new Array('gmail.com', 'lab.mcis@'); document.write("<a href='mailto:" + a[1] + a[0] + "'>" + a[1] + a[0] + "</a>");</script>

                    WHAT=@)</i></noscript>, providing us with:
        <ul class="join">
            <li>your CV</li>
            <li>your transcripts</li>
            <li>a short paper in <b>English</b> that answers the following 5 questions (each answer between 200 and 500
                words):
                <ol>
                    <li>Why would you like to do research?</li>
                    <li>What is your favourite programming language or project and why?</li>
                    <li>What open source development experience do you have?</li>
                    <li>What is your favourite editor, and why?</li>
                    <li>What are your research interests?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Note that there is no right or wrong answer to the questions above. The short paper provides <i>us</i> with a
            better view about you and your interests, and provides <i>you</i> with an opportunity to better present
            yourself. So, it is much more interesting for all of us if you write about personal anecdotes, opinions or
            situations than to remain very vague and abstract or to reuse canned responses.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Depending on how busy our schedule is, we will get back to you as soon as possible with feedback about why
            your profile might or might not fit with our lab. If you seem to be what we are looking for, we will
            schedule an interview, at which time we will explain any further steps. In any case, don't hesitate to
            contact us!</p>
