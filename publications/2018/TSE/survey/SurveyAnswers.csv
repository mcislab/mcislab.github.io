Its core is basically a set of small pieces (widgets) that introduce different UI elements or functionality, but you need to manually put those pieces together by creating an XML file that described how all those small pieces were structured on the front-end - that was basically one huge configuration file. Quite soon it became pretty obvious that those configuration files will grow immensely in size making them really hard to maintain. Also we often had to reuse some existing configuration parts across different front-end configuration files. So we created a way to include them within each other. Since XML wasn't accessed directly and was read into object form in runtime - I've written a quite complex merge algorithm that can merge all kinds of objects which also supported merging all those includes together to provide us the final configuration in runtime while keeping it simple in the original form.","Good practices:1. Structure your configuration options from the start, probably split them by responsibility/modules/plugins/etc - whatever fit your project the best2. Make each configuration option responsible for one single thing, do not reuse the same option for different cases unless it is reasonable in the application context3. Make sure to name your options properly from the start and ensure all your developers folow one naming convention across all your projects, that will save you a lot of timeBad practices:1. Do not use multiple ways of configuring your application - you don't want to end up having some settings within property files, some settings placed in XML and some being read from database2. Do not introduce configuration options unless they are actually required, in most cases extra configurations might create unnecessary complications which otherwise could be avoided3. Do not create multiple options that have the same role - it is not likely to happen in a small/new project but it could be the case in big projects, try to keep all your configurations in check"76,3,Developer,No options,No,.xml file,Via a 3rd party framework dedicated to configuration,As attributes/variables with the same name of its associated configuration option,We read configuration options in different places in the code,Any developer,Just one developer,"Yes, they are defined in the architecture specifications;No planning, options are added ad hoc",Architectural specifications.;Ad hoc choices.

Often times we can't communicate with all of our users and that creates a very big gap of understanding between developers and our userbase.  We have to guess what our users want and the issue with that is that we have an audience that is comprised of very different people who have different needs and who have very different goals. We have to account for users of our software as well as developers that build addons to it. This is even more complicated in the case of our project because we have to even consider people who aren't directly using or developing for our platform because Glowkit is a fork of an actively used project. We can't really solve this issue but we can lessen its effects by determining use cases and finding configuration options that could be created to help that use case.,"I think that every configuration option you have should be supported by a use case. Even if you don't have planning, if you can't think of a valid use case that the configuration option will help that can't be helped more by another solution, don't add it. Next, have good defaults. Know that a lot of your users will not change options and all of them will expect your software to work well with the defaults. Finally, make sure you document your options. This is extremely important. You are making these options for your users and your users are not going out of their way to find out what an option does.As for bad practices, don't make a config option for everything. You may be tempted to solve every user issue with another option, but sometimes you have to decide on some major part of your code that you will have to have a concrete flow or design for. Second, do not change configuration options too much. If your config options change rapidly, you are just making it harder for the users of your config.

If users have already started using new configuration options, the old release will not recognize them and error out, but it is also not trivial to version configuration changes together with software releases.","Good practices:- Command-line flags work really well, there's usually no need for complex data formats to store these. This eases deployment into production, because all configuration information is visible on the command-line and it also allows developers to quickly flip certain flags.- Use ""feature flags"" to activate / deactivate new code or select between code branches at runtime.- Use configuration options to ""canary"" a change in code behavior in a new release. As an example, you can deploy a new software version and only enable a new experimental code path for 1% of users at first to get some feedback.Bad practices:- Not documenting configuration options.- Not having a good naming scheme for configuration options.- Having multiple ways to configure a software (e.g. some stuff has to be configured in an XML file, others on the command-line, others in a database)."141,12,Architect,<10,Yes,".properties file;Environment variables (e.g., Bash);Application main arguments;yaml",Via a 3rd party framework dedicated to configuration;Via dedicated classes/functions that we developed for configuration access,As attributes/variables with the same name of its associated configuration option;Via method/function accessors (for example getMyOption),We read configuration options from a specific class/module,Any developer,My library won't work without a minimum configuration and the library itself was done for developers.,"Yes, they are defined in the client specifications;Yes, they are defined in the architecture specifications",Client requirements.;Architectural specifications.;Discussion between developers and architects.,Via Wiki or a web platform;Pull Request,"Yes.

Boolean options (e.g. ""deny.unauthenticated.access=true"" instead of ""spring.AccessFilter=BasicFilter\nbasic.filter.auth.paths=*"") tend to work quite well.* A central config file with all default options and comments (""little tutorials"") for each option are great.Bad:* Configuring different modules with different options (e.g. leveraging Tomcat, Spring, Hibernate config files tend to be confusing and require a lot of previous knowledge). Configuration is for users (which may include admins) and they do not have to understand all the tricky concepts inside your app.* Config documentation that sits far away from the config itself (e.g. in a wiki) tends to get stale and not consulted.* there is a middle ground between too much and too few configuration options.

I try to separate ""important"" options from the other ""detail config"" by giving specific examples on how to use the important ones in the top-level documentation.Also I've often faced the issue ""do I create two separate programs or do I just add options to one program?"". In most cases, separating the program (or at least a clearly separated ""sub-command"" in the program) is a good solution.","Good:1) Make config option docs immediately accessible - everywhere you can set the option. Also provide FULL value checking. e.g. DO NOT accept negative values where only positive values make sense.2) Clearly mark development/debugging option so the user doesnt confuse them with options he doesnt care about.3) Whatever you can automatically infer from data: Dont have it as a config option. Avoid configuration bloat (too many options which are never used).Bad:1) Require the user to write a complex config file in some arcane format (just add some default config file).2) Ignore how the user will use your application. If you have distinct usecases, just provide distinct example configs. Dont make the user hate you because he has to deal with tons of config options he doesnt really care about.3) Make configs too interdependent or too redundant. In the optimal case, provide just one way to use your program for some specific application, and avoid ""if --xyz is set, then --foo must not be set but --bar must be set"" things as far as possible. If it is unavoidable (it is sometimes!), try to auto-calculate sensible values from the other args and warn the user visibly that default value X has been used for parameter Y, and provide clear warnings when a dependency is not met (""You set --xyz, but you did not set --bar.

Maintaining forks is very hard so I think adding as much config as possible to deter forking is good2) If it is too complicated to configure something, or it requires a rebuild, or something like this, it becomes very hard to iterate quickly.
